    title: Who am I?
    text: >
      Hi! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Will. I do a lot of things. I sang tenor in choir, practiced taekwondo and kung fu, played video games, wrote stories, dreamt of goofy things, and much more. 
    text2: >
      I decided to pursue learning software during university as I fell in love with solving problems and continuously learning new things. That, coupled with my lifelong vision of inspiring and making people happy through my work, has led me to wanting to master my craft.
    text3: >
      My current goals are to graduate from my master's program, work as a software engineer at a game company, and to build something(s) that entices me to wake up in morning.
    text4: >
      Fun fact: I tried to replicate a certain game company's color scheme and design on my website. Can you guess what who it is? ðŸ‘Š
